INTRODUCTION
------------

iMan and iMandy are updated versions of iMike, originally created by Michael Ficarra.
I updated the embedded spreadsheet to create correctly sized anthropometric manikins.
Dimensions are based on 1988 data from DOD-HDBK-743A.  iMan and iMandy include the
1st, 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th and 99th percentile dimensions.

None of this would be possible without the iMike models created by Mr. Ficarra.
The updated files were renamed iMan and iMandy to avoid confusion with iMike, but
they are derivative works of iMike (including this Read-Me.txt file).

iMan and iMandy look best if you uncheck "Edges" for Active Components under
"Shaded display modes" found on the Tools >> Application Options >> Display tab.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Unzip the files and put into a directory included in your Inventor project path.
Inventor 2010 or later version required!


HOW TO USE THE MODELS
---------------------

  1. Open the iMan.iam or iMandy.iam assembly file.

  2. Constrain the manikin as necessary to locate in your model.

  3. Grab and move the hands, arms, or legs.  Constraints have been added so the
     manikin moves somewhat ergonomically.  Move the fingers and the hands will
     rotate at the wrists; Move the legs and the knees will bend while keeping
     the feet parallel to the ground.

  4. Modify the user parameters for common constraints override.

  5. Suppress constraints for more mobility.  Add new constraints as required.


HOW TO CHANGE THE MANIKIN'S SIZE
--------------------------------

  1. In the assembly browser, click the plus sign (+) next to the 1st part, either
     "iMan - 2D BODY:1" or "iMandy - 2D BODY:1" (if not already expanded).

  2. In the assembly browser, click the plus sign (+) next to "3rd Party".

  3. In the assembly browser, right-click the DIMENSION PICKER and select Edit.

  4. After Excel opens, use the dropdown box (cell E4) to select your manikin size.

  5. Close the Excel window.  Select the "Manage" command from Inventor's menu and
     then perform an "Update".  The model should update in a few seconds.
 
  6. The new manikin size will be saved when you save the model.
